After reading the book [A New Kind of Science](https://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/toc.html) by Stephen Wolfram I spend some time studying Cellular Automata.
For this I wrote my own general rule-evaluator that you can find [here](https://github.com/natj/CellularAutomata.jl).
Turns out that you can produce pretty wonky pictures when altering the usual Game of Life rules.
Although I still need to actually write some decent visualization script to show these.
