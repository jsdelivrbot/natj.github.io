> Spectral measurements of thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray bursts from low mass X-ray binaries have been used to measure neutron star (NS) masses and radii.
> A number of systematic issues affect such measurements and have raised concerns as to the robustness of the methods.
> We present analysis of the X-ray emission from bursts observed from 4U 1608-52 at various persistent fluxes.
> We find a strong dependence of the burst properties on the flux and spectral hardness of the persistent emission before burst.
> Bursts occurring during the low-accretion rate (hard) state exhibit evolution of the black body normalisation consistent with the theoretical predictions of NS atmosphere models.
> However, bursts occurring during the high-accretion rate (soft) state show roughly constant normalisation, which is inconsistent with the NS atmosphere models and therefore these bursts cannot be easily used to determine NS parameters.
> We analyse the hard-state burst to put the lower limit on the neutron star radius in 4U 1608-52 of 13 km (for masses 1.2-2.4 $$M_{\odot}$$).
> The best agreement with the theoretical NS mass-radius relations is achieved for source distances in the range 3.1-3.7 kpc.
> We expect that the radius limit will be 10 per cent lower if spectral models including rapid rotation are used instead.
