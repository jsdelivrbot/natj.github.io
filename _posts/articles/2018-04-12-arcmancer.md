## Arcmancer 

Arcmancer is a general purpose ray tracer. Actually it is so general purpose that it is more of a differential geometry solver. We just happen to specialize it to 3D and curved spacetimes!



You can find the article from [Arxiv.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04670)

And the actual code is here: [Arcmancer Bitbucket repository.](https://bitbucket.org/popiha/arcmancer)
